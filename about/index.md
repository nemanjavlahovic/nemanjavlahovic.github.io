Hello. My name is Nemanja Vlahović.
I'm a 24-year-old & iOS developer currently living in Belgrade with a passion for music, art and technology.
More information can be found through [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nemanjavlahovic).

I currently work at [mySkin inc](https://www.myskin.com) building the iOS app used for interacting with beautiful skin-scanning device called OKU.

When I'm not programming, I love to make music, mostly ambient these days. You can check it out on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/subsidedmusic).
